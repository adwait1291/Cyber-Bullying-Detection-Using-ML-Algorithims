## Project Description
This Project uses machine learning algorithms to classify comments as bullying and non-bullying.
</br>
</br>

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project is taken from the Kaggle website. The dataset has 20000 comments labeled as bullying and non-bullying. 
</br>
</br>

## Text preprocessing steps 
1. Converted text to lower-case
2. Removed punctuations
3. Removed words containing numbers
4. Removed english stopwords
5. Part of speech tagging
6. Used Lemmatization
7. Removed words with only one letter
</br>
</br>

## Feature extraction
1. Used CountVectorizer to convert preprocessed comments to feature vectors
</br>
</br>

## Algorithms
1. K-Nearest Neighbors
2. Naive Bayes
3. Logistic Regression
4. Support Vector Classifier
</br>
